This package provides server startup and shutdown wrappers that can be used
with libraries and servers that are stated with nject.

### How to structure your application

Libraries become injected dependencies.  They can in turn have other libraries
as dependencies of them.  Since only the depenencies that are required are 
actaully injected, the easiest thing is to have a master list of all your libraries
and provide that to all your apps.

Let's call that master list `allLibraries`.

```go
app, err := nserve.CreateApp("myApp", allLibrariesSequence, createAppFunction)
err = app.Do(nserve.Start)
err = app.Do(nserve.Stop)
```

### Hooks

Libaries and appliations can register callbacks on a per-hook basis.  Two hooks
are pre-provided by other hooks can be created.

Hook invocation can be limited by a timeout.  If the hook does not complete in
that amount of time, the hook will return error and continue processing in the
background.

The Start, Stop, and Shutdown hooks are pre-defined:

```go
var Shutdown = NewHook("shutdown", ReverseOrder)
var Stop = NewHook("stop", ReverseOrder).OnError(Shutdown).ContinuePastError(true)
var Start = NewHook("start", ForwardOrder).OnError(Stop)
```

Hooks can be invoked in registration order (`ForwardOrder`) or in 
reverse registration order `ReverseOrder`.  

If there is an `OnError` modifier for the hook registration, then that
hook gets invoked if there is an error returned when the hook is running.

Libraries and applications can register callbacks for hooks by taking an
`*nserve.App` as as an input parameter and then using that to register callbacks:

```go
func CreateMyLibrary(app *nserve.App) *MyLibrary {
	lib := &MyLibrary{ ... }
	app.On(Start, lib.Start)
	return lib
}
func (lib *MyLibrary) Start(app *nserve.App) {
	app.On(Stop, lib.Stop)
}
```

The callback function can be any nject injection chain.  If it ends with a
function that can return
error, then any such error will be become the error return from `app.Do` and if
there is an `OnError` handler for that hook, that handler will be invoked.
